Here is my project in C++ about manage cost, revenue and income of a fashion store.
Here is some basic rules:
- 1 product has only 1 id. The user can only add a product if all information match, only quantity purchase is different, or the product’s id has not exist att all.
- 1 employee has only 1 id. The user can only add a employee if the employee’s id has not exist att all in the system.
- The user can find, edit or remove a product or en employee with the id number. 
- The user can only edit id number if the new id number does not exist in the system. 
- Every time when the user want to edit a product’s information or remove a product, the product’s information will be shown first. The user can chose if they want to change/remove it.
